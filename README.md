## Custom Alphabet Sort

### Prompt

Please create a GitHub repo that is publicly available with a solution to the following problem. The solution can be in any language, with preference given to solutions in TypeScript. Please include instructions on how to run your code.
We need to alphabetically order a string. For example, given the input “HiiveIsLive", the output “eehiiiilsvv" is produced.
We need to further extend the function to take a second input which is a custom alphabet. The input should be an ordered list of all 26 characters in any order. The function should use this alphabet for ordering the input string.

### Quickstart
